# WeightedMeanCompletion

## TODO
### Collect Phenotype data
- collect curated media from bacdive dsmz
- collect phenotypes/physiology/morphology from bacdive dsmz
- collect phenotypes from microPIE

### Phylogeny data
- Cophenetic distance matrix of 3,737 bacterial strains
The distance matrix was direectly derived from the following source:
PhyloPhlAn is a new method for improved phylogenetic and taxonomic placement of microbes 
Nicola Segata, Daniela BÃ¶rnigen, Xochitl C. Morgan, and Curtis Huttenhower. Nature Communications 4, 2013
  

### Coding Tasks
- perform standard matrix-completion/interpolation: EM, regulariztion, nuclear norm...
- machine learning approach to matrix-completion/interpolation
- Weighted Mean Completion approach to matrix-completion/interpolation
