# WeightedMeanCompletion

## TODO
### Collect Phenotype data
- collect curated media from bacdive dsmz
- collect phenotypes/physiology/morphology from bacdive dsmz
- collect phenotypes from microPIE

### Collect Phylogeny data
- get phylogeny relevant to level of detail necessary

### Coding Tasks
- perform standard matrix-completion/interpolation: EM, regulariztion, nuclear norm...
- machine learning approach to matrix-completion/interpolation
- Weighted Mean Completion approach to matrix-completion/interpolation
